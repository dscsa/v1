1. SCOPE.
a. Donor Organization may, from time to time, donate certain Products and/or Equipment by using SIRUM as an information service. Potential recipients having a demand for such Products and/or Equipment may, from time to time, seek to accept such donations of such Products and/or Equipment (the "Donee Organization").  SIRUM seeks to (i) make introductions of Donor Organizations and Donee Organizations, (ii)  make available information relating to Donor Organizations, Donee Organizations and Products and/or Equipment, and (iii) facilitate the donation of Products and Equipment by Donor Organizations and receipt of such Products and Equipment by Donee Organizations by performing certain purely administrative functions (including, but not limited to, (1) creating prepaid shipping labels using addresses provided by Donee Organizations and Donor Organizations, (2) mailing such shipping labels to Donor Organizations, and (3) processing donation records and instructions provided by Donor Organization) (the services listed in (i), (ii) and (iii) are hereinafter referred to as the "SIRUM Services").

b. Donor Organization understands and agrees that SIRUM and its Affiliated Parties (as defined below), in supplying the SIRUM Services, do not act as wholesalers, brokers, jobbers, agents, reverse distributors, sellers, resellers, distributors, or suppliers for purposes of products liability law or for any other purpose.  In no event will Donor Organization deliver any Products and/or Equipment to SIRUM, nor will SIRUM in any event take possession of any Products and/or Equipment.

c. For the purpose of this Agreement, Affiliated Parties shall mean all employees, members, advisors, directors, officers, agents, financial contributors, affiliates, or any other individual or entity acting on behalf of SIRUM. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Products and/or Equipment" may include but are not limited to medication, medical supplies, medical pamphlets or information (in electronic, written, or other form), pharmaceutical products, research supplies, lab equipment, medical devices, transport or storage facilities, and any other materials which a Donor Organization may seek to donate, or which a Donee Organization may seek to receive, through use of the SIRUM Services.  The term Products and/or Equipment includes materials that are available by prescription only ("Rx Products"), as well as those that can be obtained without prescription ("OTC Products").

2. TERM AND TERMINATION.  
Donor Organization agrees that SIRUM, in its sole discretion and for any reason or no reason, may terminate this Agreement and may discontinue the SIRUM Services at any time, with or without notice.  Donor Organization agrees that SIRUM will not be liable to Donor Organization or any third party for any such termination.  Without limiting the foregoing, SIRUM reserves the right to terminate, discontinue and/or suspend the SIRUM Services for any suspected non-compliance with this Agreement, and such non-compliance may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.  These remedies are in addition to any other remedies SIRUM may have at law or in equity.

3. CONFIDENTIALITY.  
Donor Organization agrees that neither it nor any of its employees will use or disclose to any third party, except as expressly permitted herein, certain technical information, as well as information about business plans and strategies, promotions, other donors, donees, and related non-technical business information which SIRUM considers to be confidential (collectively, "Confidential Information").  In the event such information is disclosed, the information shall (a) be marked as confidential at the time of disclosure, or (b) if disclosed orally but stated to be confidential, be reduced to a written summary designated as confidential after such oral disclosure. Donor Organization agrees to require every Donor Organization employee who will have access to, use of, or knowledge of the Confidential Information to execute (in advance of and as a condition to such access, use or knowledge) a confidentiality agreement including terms substantially similar to those contained in this Section.  Donor Organization agrees that it will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of the Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than those persons authorized hereunder to have any such information, which measures shall include the highest degree of care that Donor Organization utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature.  Donor Organization agrees to notify SIRUM in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information which may come to Donor Organization's attention.

4. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF DONOR ORGANIZATION.
a. Donor Organization hereby represents, warrants and covenants that it complies with, and will continue to comply with, all applicable laws and has obtained all applicable governmental and regulatory approvals, consents, permits and licenses required to manufacture and/or distribute Products and/or Equipment in the United States.  Such laws include but are not limited to local, state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances enacted to permit distribution of Product and/or Equipment ("Donation Distribution Laws").

In addition, if a HIPAA Addendum is attached hereto as an Appendix 1, Donor Organization acknowledges and agrees that the specific terms and conditions of such HIPAA Addendum are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement and shall apply and govern how PHI may be used and disclosed by Donor Organization.

DONOR ORGANIZATION UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT SIRUM IS ONLY AN INFORMATION PROVIDER HELPING TO CONNECT DONORS WITH DONEES, ANY SIRUM SERVICES TO FACILITATE A DONOR ORGANIZATION'S DONATION OF PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT OR THE RECEIPT OF SUCH PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT BY A DONEE ORGANIZATION ARE PURELY ADMINISTRATIVE IN NATURE, AND SIRUM DOES NOT DISTRIBUTE, TAKE POSSESSION OR IN ANY WAY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT(S) AND/OR EQUIPMENT DONATED THROUGH THE SIRUM SERVICE. DONOR ORGANIZATION UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THE PRODUCTS AND/OR EQUIPMENT DONATED BY DONOR ORGANIZATION WITH INFORMATION AND SUPPORT PROVIDED BY SIRUM AND/OR AFFILIATED PARTIES ARE DONOR ORGANIZATION'S FULL RESPONSIBILITY. 

b. DONOR ORGANIZATION ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DONEE'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO DONEE ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS WITH DONEE ORGANIZATION'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE DONEE USER AGREEMENT WITH SIRUM OF WHICH DONOR ORGANIZATION IS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY.

c. SIRUM PROVIDES NO WARRANTIES OR ASSURANCES (EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED), REPRESENTATIONS, OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND SIRUM, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATED PARTIES, HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS.
  
6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SIRUM OR ITS AFFILIATED PARTIES BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSS, ARISING OUT OF USE OF THE SIRUM SERVICES, OR THE DONATION, REQUEST, RECEIPT OR USE OF A PRODUCT AND/OR EQUIPMENT, EVEN IF SIRUM OR ITS AFFILIATED PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSS.

7. INDEMNIFICATION.
Donor Organization agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold SIRUM and its Affiliated Parties harmless from any claims, liability, loss, damage or injury of any kind, including attorney's fees and costs of litigation, directly or indirectly resulting from or associated with (i) Donor Organization's use of the SIRUM Services, including the introduction to any Donee Organization; (ii) the Products and/or Equipment delivered by Donor Organization, (iii) any breach by Donor Organization of this Agreement, including without limitation any breach of its representations, warranties and covenants provided in Section 4 this Agreement, and/or (iv) any non-compliance or alleged non-compliance by Donor Organization with any applicable law. Donor Organization further acknowledges and agrees that it will not seek indemnity or contribution or injunctive relief from SIRUM and/or Affiliated Parties or bring legal action of any kind against SIRUM and/or Affiliated Parties, for damages, injury, or loss of any kind arising out of any donation by, or information or services provided by, Donor Organization to third parties, or the use of the SIRUM Services supplied by SIRUM or Affiliated Parties. Nothing in this clause shall preclude SIRUM from participating in its own defense and Donor Organization agrees to provide SIRUM and/or Affiliated Parties the right to participate in all decisions relating to their defense including appointment of adequate counsel. Should SIRUM or Affiliated Parties be required to bring legal action to enforce the terms of this Agreement, it is agreed that SIRUM and Affiliated Parties, if prevailing, shall be entitled to an award of costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

8. PROMOTION.
a. SIRUM may, from time to time, issue press releases or other publicity, marketing or promotional materials and media, including but not limited to (i) an announcement regarding the relationship contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) presentations and marketing materials directed towards potential future partners, potential donee organizations and any other potential donor organizations ("Marketing Release(s)").  In addition to usage of the Donor Organization's name in such Marketing Releases, Donor Organization understands and acknowledges that SIRUM may use information regarding the names, quantities and other characteristics of Products or Equipment inputted by or given by Donor Organization or any other non-confidential information related to Donor Organization; provided that in using such information, the information is de-identified.  For clarification, "de-identified information" means information regarding the names, quantities and other characteristics of Products or Equipment inputted by or given by Donor Organization or any other non-confidential information related to Donor Organization, that has been generalized or aggregated such that the information cannot be directly or solely tied to the Donor Organization (i.e. Donor Organization information which is aggregated with the information of other donor organizations and used in charts and statistics to publicize the types and/or quantities of donations given during a specified time period).  In the event that SIRUM uses non-de-identified information related to the Donor Organization, SIRUM will request prior written approval (which may be communicated by mail or electronic transmission) in which Donor Organization will have 5 business days to respond.  If no response is received after 5 business days, Donor Organization is deemed to have approved such public announcement utilizing the non-de-identified information.
  
b. Subject to SIRUM's prior written approval (which may be communicated by mail or electronic transmission), Donor Organization may display and use the logos, trade names, trademarks, and service marks of SIRUM for the purpose of marketing the relationship and philanthropic work of the parties, subject to the following conditions:  (i) it shall keep intact any proprietary notices; (ii) it shall comply with SIRUM's trademark use guidelines as communicated to Donor Organization; (iii) it acknowledges that all goodwill generated through its use of SIRUM's logos, trade names, trademarks and service marks will inure to the benefit of SIRUM; (iv) it hereby assigns and agrees to assign to SIRUM any and all goodwill generated through its use of SIRUM's logos, trade names, trademarks and service marks, without any payment or other consideration to it, and further agrees to take all actions necessary to effect such assignment; and (v) upon termination of this Agreement, it shall cease using the logos, trade names, trademarks and service marks of SIRUM.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.
a. Governing law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to any conflicts of law principles.

b. Arbitration. In the event a dispute arises between the parties hereto arising out of or in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or any breach thereof, such dispute shall be determined and settled by arbitration in Santa Clara County in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The award rendered thereon by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties thereto, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable or injunctive relief.

c. Assignment. This Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Donor Organization without the prior written consent of SIRUM. SIRUM may assign this Agreement to any successor of SIRUM by way of merger, consolidation, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of SIRUM's business and assets related to this Agreement without the consent of Donor Organization. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement not in compliance with this Section shall be null and void. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each party hereto, its successors and permitted assigns.

d. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed void in whole or in part for any reason whatsoever, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The parties shall make a good faith effort to replace any such provision with a valid and enforceable one such that the objectives contemplated by the parties when entering this Agreement may be realized.

e. Non-Waiver. No failure or delay of one of the parties to insist upon strict performance of any of its rights or powers under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any other single or partial exercise of such right or power preclude any other further exercise of any rights or remedies provided by law.

f. Survival.  Upon termination of this Agreement, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration.
